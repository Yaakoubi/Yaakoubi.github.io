  <p style="font-size: 120%; text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0;">
    I've recently been appointed as an Assistant Professor at the <a href="https://www.concordia.ca/ginacody.html">Gina Cody School of Engineering and Computer Science at Concordia University</a>, starting Fall 2024! I'm establishing my new research group, so please don't hesitate to reach out for collaboration or supervision (<a href="https://form.jotform.com/yassineyaakoubi/application">here</a>, for <b>M.Sc.</b> and <b>Ph.D.</b>).

<span style="font-size: 80%;">My research interests lie at the intersection of <b>optimization, learning, and simulation techniques</b> for large-scale, real-world decision-making. I use <b>quantitative methods</b> (e.g., mixed-integer and stochastic programming, decomposition methods, meta-/hyperheuristics) alongside <b>machine learning models</b> (e.g., deep learning, reinforcement learning, structured prediction, and graph models) to create <u><b>efficient, robust, and scalable decision-support systems</b></u>. My work is bifurcated into two trajectories: <b>(1) ML-augmented optimization</b> and <b>(2) end-to-end optimization learning</b>. By leveraging advanced algorithms, I aim to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and manage uncertainties in areas such as <b>logistics, transportation, and sustainable supply/value chains</b>, providing tangible benefits to industries and society.</span>
