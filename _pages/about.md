I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow at McGill University's COSMO (Stochastic Mine Planning Laboratory) and an IVADO Postdoctoral Fellow under the Strategic Research Funding Program.

My research interests lie at the intersection of combinatorial optimization, stochastic programming, and machine learning. My research focuses on developing large-scale decision support systems for sustainable logistics, intelligent transportation systems, and sustainable supply/value chains. I am passionate about creating innovative solutions that have a significant societal and industrial impact, with a strong emphasis on sustainability and efficiency.


I received my Ph.D. in Mathematics from Polytechnique Montréal, where I worked on combining artificial intelligence and mathematical programming for airline crew scheduling under the supervision of François Soumis and Simon Lacoste-Julien. Prior to that, I completed my Maîtrise (MSc equivalent) in Applied Mathematics at Polytechnique Montréal and Institut polytechnique de Grenoble, and my Engineering Diploma in Information Technology at Institut polytechnique de Grenoble.
