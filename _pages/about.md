<span style="font-size: 80%;">I am currently an IVADO-COSMO Postdoctoral Fellow at McGill University, collaborating with Roussos Dimitrakopoulos on data-driven lifelong learning stochastic optimizers for decision-making under uncertainty. The project is titled "Smart Mineral Value/Supply Chains", generously funded by the COSMO Consortium and IVADO Strategic Research Funding Program "Integrated Machine Learning and Optimization for Decision Making under Uncertainty" project, led by Erick Delage, Emma Frejinger and Yossiri Adulyasak.</span>


<span style="font-size: 80%;">Before my current role, I received my Ph.D. in Mathematics from Polytechnique Montréal, where I worked on combining artificial intelligence and mathematical programming for airline crew scheduling under the supervision of François Soumis and Simon Lacoste-Julien. Prior to that, I completed a dual degree Maîtrise (MSc equivalent) in Applied Mathematics at Polytechnique Montréal, and an Engineering Diploma from the Grenoble Institute of Technology, with a triple major and double minor, graduating with the highest honors.</span>


<span style="font-size: 80%;">My research interests lie in the intersection of optimization, learning, and simulation techniques for large-scale, real-world decision-making. I use quantitative methods (e.g., mixed-integer and stochastic programming, column generation, meta-/hyperheuristics) alongside machine learning models (e.g., deep learning, reinforcement learning, structured prediction and graph models) to create efficient, robust, and scalable decision-support systems. My work is bifurcated into two trajectories: (1) ML-augmented optimization, and (2) end-to-end optimization learning. By leveraging advanced algorithms, I aim to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and manage uncertainties in areas such as logistics, transportation, and sustainable supply/value chains, providing tangible benefits to industries and society.</span>
