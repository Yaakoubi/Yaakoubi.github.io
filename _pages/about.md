<span style="font-size: 80%;">I am currently an [IVADO-COSMO Postdoctoral Fellow](https://ivado.ca/) at McGill University, collaborating with [Roussos Dimitrakopoulos](https://www.mcgill.ca/mining/people-0/faculty/roussos-dimitrakopoulos) on data-driven lifelong learning stochastic optimizers for decision-making under uncertainty. The project is titled "Smart Mineral Value/Supply Chains", generously funded by the [COSMO Consortium](https://cosmo.mcgill.ca/about/industry-government-support/) and [IVADO Strategic Research Funding Program](https://ivado.ca/en/scholarships-and-grants/strategic-framework-research-programs/) "Integrated Machine Learning and Optimization for Decision Making under Uncertainty" project, led by [Erick Delage](https://www.hec.ca/profs/erick.delage.html), [Yossiri Adulyasak](https://www.hec.ca/profs/yossiri.adulyasak.html), and [Emma Frejinger](https://diro.umontreal.ca/repertoire-departement/professeurs/professeur/in/in15868/sg/Emma%20Frejinger/).</span>


<span style="font-size: 80%;">Before my current role, I received my [Ph.D. in Mathematics](https://www.polymtl.ca/programmes/programmes/option-mathematiques-de-lingenieur) from Polytechnique Montréal, where I worked on combining artificial intelligence and mathematical programming for airline crew scheduling under the supervision of [François Soumis](https://www.gerad.ca/fr/people/francois-soumis) and [Simon Lacoste-Julien](http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~slacoste/), in [GERAD](https://www.gerad.ca/) & [Mila](https://mila.quebec/). Prior to that, I completed a dual degree [Maîtrise (MSc equivalent) in Applied Mathematics](https://www.polymtl.ca/programmes/programmes/maitrise-recherche-en-mathematiques-appliquees) at Polytechnique Montréal, and an Engineering Diploma from the [Grenoble Institute of Technology](https://www.grenoble-inp.fr/en), with a triple major and double minor, graduating with the highest honors.</span>


<span style="font-size: 80%;">My research interests lie in the intersection of <b>optimization, learning, and simulation techniques</b> for large-scale, real-world decision-making. I use <b>quantitative methods</b> (e.g., mixed-integer and stochastic programming, column generation, meta-/hyperheuristics) alongside <b>machine learning models</b> (e.g., deep learning, reinforcement learning, structured prediction and graph models) to create efficient, robust, and scalable decision-support systems. My work is bifurcated into two trajectories: <b>(1) ML-augmented optimization</b>, and <b>(2) end-to-end optimization learning</b>. By leveraging advanced algorithms, I aim to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and manage uncertainties in areas such as <b>logistics, transportation, and sustainable supply/value chains</b>, providing tangible benefits to industries and society.</span>
