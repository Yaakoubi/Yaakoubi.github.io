I am currently an IVADO-COSMO Postdoctoral Fellow at McGill University, collaborating with Professor Roussos Dimitrakopoulos on the Strategic Research Funding Program titled "Smart Mineral Value/Supply Chains." My research is centered on the development of data-driven lifelong learning stochastic optimizers for sustainable mineral resource management within the IVADO Strategic Research Funding Program "Integrated Machine Learning and Optimization for Decision Making under Uncertainty" project, led by Erick Delage and Emma Frejinger and Yossiri Adulyasak.


Before my current role, I received my Ph.D. in Mathematics from Polytechnique Montréal, where I worked on combining artificial intelligence and mathematical programming for airline crew scheduling under the supervision of François Soumis and Simon Lacoste-Julien. Prior to that, I completed a double degree Maîtrise (MSc equivalent) in Applied Mathematics at Polytechnique Montréal and Institut polytechnique de Grenoble. My thesis focused on column generation and machine learning for airline crew pairing, under the supervision of François Soumis. I also hold an Engineering Diploma in Information Technology from Institut polytechnique de Grenoble, with a triple major and double minor, graduating with the highest honors.


My research interests lie at the intersection of optimization, learning, and simulation methods to develop decision-making algorithms for real-world applications, with a focus on large-scale optimization problems. I develop quantitative methods, including mixed-integer and stochastic programming, column generation, and meta-/hyperheuristics, to create efficient and scalable decision-support systems that have a significant societal and industrial impact, with a strong emphasis on sustainability and efficiency. My research bifurcates into two main trajectories: (1) ML-augmented optimization, guiding solvers to navigate the search space through learning heuristics or learning to branch and cut, and (2) end-to-end optimization learning, focusing on predicting, constructing, and generating solutions through learning with constraints and/or on graphs Driven by a vision to develop robust, efficient, and scalable decision-support systems, my research leverages advanced algorithms to enhance efficiency, reduce costs, and support more effective decision-making under uncertainty across domains, such as logistics, transportation, and sustainable supply/value chains. My long-term goal is to foster innovation and create efficient, robust, and scalable decision-support systems with a social purpose, benefiting industries and society.
